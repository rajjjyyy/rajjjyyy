About me:

   I am currently a 4th year college Computer Science student, an academic scholar of University of Cebu Lapu-Lapu and Mandaue.
I have consistently been at the Dean's lister and a high achieving student who contributes to affiliated and non-affiliated student
and volunteer organization alike. Aside from honing my computer programming skills, I tend to contribute more to society through 
experiences in mass communications, social networking, and braodcasting alike. I enjoy watching anime, playing games, reading manga, 
and obsessing over niche subjects.

as for my skillsets and achievements alike, I would like to redirect you to my site:
